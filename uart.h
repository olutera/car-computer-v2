Changelog for modifications made by Tim Sharpe, starting with the current
  library version on his Web site as of 05/01/2009.

Date        Description
=========================================================================
05/12/2009  Added Arduino-style available() and flush() functions for both
			supported UARTs.  Really wanted to keep them out of the library, so
			that it would be as close as possible to Peter Fleury's original
			library, but has scoping issues accessing internal variables from
			another program.  Go C!

 *  @code #include <uart.h> @endcode
 *
 *  @brief Interrupt UART library using the built-in UART with transmit and receive circular buffers.
 *
 *  This library can be used to transmit and receive data through the built in UART.
 *
 *  An interrupt is generated when the UART has finished transmitting or
 *  receiving a byte. The interrupt handling routines use circular buffers
 *  for buffering received and transmitted data.
 *
 *  The UART_RX_BUFFER_SIZE and UART_TX_BUFFER_SIZE constants define
 *  the size of the circular buffers in bytes. Note that these constants must be a power of 2.
 *  You may need to adapt this constants to your target and your application by adding
 *  CDEFS += -DUART_RX_BUFFER_SIZE=nn -DUART_RX_BUFFER_SIZE=nn to your Makefile.
 *
 *  @note Based on Atmel Application Note AVR306
